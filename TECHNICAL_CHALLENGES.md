# Technical Challenges & Mitigation Strategies

## Challenge 1: Dynamic Skill Ontology Development

### Problem Statement
Creating a comprehensive, evolving skill taxonomy that accurately represents the global labor market while adapting to emerging skills and regional variations.

### Root Causes
- Rapid technological evolution creates new skills
- Regional and industry-specific terminology variations
- Implicit skills are difficult to codify
- Cross-cultural skill equivalence mapping

### Mitigation Strategies

#### Hybrid Ontology Approach
```python
class SkillOntology:
    def __init__(self):
        self.base_framework = self.load_established_frameworks()
        self.ai_discovery = AISkillDiscovery()
        self.human_validation = HumanValidationLayer()
    
    def discover_emerging_skills(self, job_descriptions):
        # AI-driven pattern recognition
        emerging_skills = self.ai_discovery.analyze_trends(job_descriptions)
        return self.human_validation.validate(emerging_skills)
