MEGA PROMPT: Architecting "Project Synapse" - An Agentic AI Platform for Workforce Transformation
YOUR ROLE: Chief AI Architect
OBJECTIVE: Produce a comprehensive technical and strategic blueprint for a multi-agent AI platform designed to solve the fundamental disconnect in the global job market.

1. PROJECT MANDATE: The "Project Synapse" Vision
We are building a unified, dual-sided AI platform that serves two primary user bases with a single, integrated goal: to make skills the universal currency of the labor market.

Side A: The AI Career Coach & Personal Architect for Every Professional

The Problem: Individuals don't know what skills they have, what skills are needed for the jobs of tomorrow, or how to bridge the gap.

The Solution: An intelligent, proactive agent that acts as a lifelong career companion. A user can provide their resume, LinkedIn profile, or even describe their experience in plain text. The platform will:

Deconstruct & Map: Extract and codify their explicit and implicit skills into a dynamic, living "Skills DNA" profile.

Analyze & Project: Compare their "Skills DNA" against real-time job market data to identify high-potential career paths and critical skill gaps.

Prescribe & Guide: Generate a hyper-personalized, adaptive learning path. This isn't a static list of courses; it's a dynamic plan that curates micro-learning content, project recommendations, and mentorship opportunities tailored to close their specific gaps efficiently.

Connect & Optimize: Connect them to relevant job opportunities where their profile is a strong match.

Side B: The AI Talent Scout & Strategic Workforce Planner for Enterprises

The Problem: Employers struggle with inefficient, keyword-based resume screening, leading to poor-quality candidates, high hiring costs, and a lack of visibility into the actual skills of their workforce.

The Solution: An intelligent sourcing and assessment engine that moves beyond the resume. For a given job role, the platform will:

Define & Deconstruct: Analyze a job description to create a detailed "Role DNA," a structured model of required skills, competencies, and seniority levels.

Source & Match: Proactively search the platform's talent pool (from Side A) to find candidates whose "Skills DNA" aligns with the "Role DNA," focusing on potential and aptitude, not just past job titles.

Assess & Qualify: Conduct initial, adaptive, AI-driven interviews. This goes beyond simple Q&A; it involves simulating real-world tasks, evaluating problem-solving approaches, and measuring competency through interactive scenarios.

Shortlist & Recommend: Provide employers with a curated shortlist of pre-vetted, highly qualified candidates, complete with a breakdown of their strengths and developmental areas relative to the role.

The Core Technological Bet: This entire ecosystem will be powered by a multi-agent AI architecture where specialized, autonomous AI agents work together to perform these complex, interconnected tasks. The CEO has described this as a "21-layer architecture," indicating a highly structured, modular, and complex system design.

2. OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
1. DECOMPOSE the "21-Layer Architecture"
Propose a logical and technically sound breakdown of what these 21 layers could represent. Structure them into cohesive groups (Data, Core AI, Agentic Orchestration, Services, Experience). Provide a name and a one-sentence description for each of the 21 hypothetical layers.

2. DESIGN the Multi-Agent System
Define the key autonomous AI agents. For each, specify:
* Agent Name & Primary Goal
* Core Responsibilities & Tasks
* Key Tools/Models (e.g., a specific LLM, vector database, custom algorithm)
* Interaction Protocol with other agents.

3. DETAIL the Tech Stack Implementation
Propose a concrete, modern tech stack based on the mentioned tools (LangGraph, AWS, Python, etc.).
* Agent Framework & Orchestration: Precisely how LangGraph manages state and flow.
* Cloud Infrastructure (AWS): Specific services (e.g., ECS/EKS, S3, RDS, SageMaker).
* Data & ML Ops: Tools for feature stores, model registries, pipeline orchestration.
* Frontend/Backend: Suggested frameworks.

4. MAP the High-Level System Flow
Create two detailed sequence diagrams (described in text or Mermaid.js format) showing the end-to-end flow for:
a) A Career Seeker's Journey: From profile upload to receiving a personalized learning plan.
b) An Employer's Journey: From posting a job to receiving a shortlist.

5. IDENTIFY Key Technical Challenges & Mitigations
List the 5 most significant technical hurdles in building this platform and propose a strategic mitigation for each.

6. PROPOSE a Phased Development Roadmap
Outline a 3-phase plan (MVP -> Integration -> Scale) with clear objectives and timelines.

Format your response using clear headings, sub-headings, bullet points, and tables where appropriate. The output should be a self-contained, actionable architectural document for a engineering team.
